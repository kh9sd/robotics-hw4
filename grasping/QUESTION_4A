While the model trains to be better at matching the data in the training set, the validation set is independent of it. As the weights are adjusted through training it could lead to irregularities where the weights on the epoch are worse when applied to the validation dataset compared to a past version. However, in general the validation loss trends down so the model is becoming more accurate.
