a. Using a simulation allows for quicker training times since you can just speed up the simulation, compared to real-life where you have to wait for the robot to actually move. In addition, it is safer thanks to not having to deal with an actual swinging robot arm that could injure people.

b. Yes, sometimes the objects sink into the ground from the arm pushing it, which is inaccurate to what happens on a hard surface in real life.
