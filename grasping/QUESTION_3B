The different resolutions are useful to break up the task of task planning into 2 parts. The lower resolution can be useful for finding the general "region" the object is in, which requires global information. The higher resolution is needed to actually account for the precise position, shape, and orientation of the object. This is more local information, after narrowing down the general info from the lower resolution filter.
